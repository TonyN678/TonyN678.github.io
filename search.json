[{"content":"Building a DIY Power Meter \u0026 Logger with Arduino Nano and INA219 In this project, I’ll walk you through how I built a simple but accurate power meter and data logger using three main components: an Arduino Nano, the INA219 current/voltage monitoring IC, and a 16×2 LCD display. The goal was to create a compact device that can measure voltage, current, and power in real time—and also log the data for later analysis.\nExplanation of why this circuit is WRONG for only measuring the BATTERY, not shunt voltage through load!!! The SDA and SDL pins of the INA219 and the LCD Display must be connect to the A4 and A5 pins of the Nano respectively ( A4 and A5 are in charge of I2C communication, on Arduino Uno board it has its own SDA and SDL pins). The LCD Display is powered by 5V from 5V pin of Nano. LOAD’s VCC is connected to V- pin of INA219 while its GND is connected to GND. (load is literally anything that consume power ie. resistor convert electricity to heat, IC got powered by power, …. Battery pack is ~3V, this is measured in the LCD to be around 3.2V across the load; The load is there for current to flow through so INA219 can measure shunt voltage; BATT+ –\u003e INA219’s V+, BATT- –\u003e GND. TRUE schematic for measuring shunt voltage across a LOAD LOAD’s GND –\u003e BATT’s GND, LOAD’s VCC –\u003e V- of INA219 !!!\nThe shunt voltage (voltage drop) across LED is around 1.0V with 92mA current\nUnderstanding the INA219 Power Monitor The INA219 is the key component that makes this power meter project both accurate and easy to build. It’s a precision high-side current and voltage sensor developed by Texas Instruments, and it allows the Arduino to measure:\nBus Voltage (the voltage of the system you’re powering) Shunt Voltage (the small voltage drop across a shunt resistor) Current (calculated using the shunt voltage) Power (voltage × current) What makes the INA219 especially useful for hobby projects is that it handles all the difficult analog measurements internally and provides clean, digital readings over I²C (basically mentioning SDL and SDA pins on the module apart from VCC \u0026 GND), so you don’t need ADC calibration or amplification stages.\nWhy You Need a Load in a Power Measurement Circuit When using the INA219 (or any current-sensing device), you must have a load connected in the circuit. The load is the component, module, or device that actually consumes electrical power, such as a motor, LED strip, battery charger, or any electronic device under test.\n1. Current Only Flows When There Is a Load The INA219 measures current by detecting the small voltage drop across the shunt resistor. But current only flows if there is something drawing power. Without a load, there is no current through the shunt resistor — so the INA219 will read: 0 mA and 0 mW.\n2. Power = Voltage × Current Electrical power can only exist when both voltage and current are present. Even if the power supply is connected, without a load:\nVoltage is present But current is zero This means the power is also zero.\n3. The INA219 Needs a Voltage Drop to Measure Current The INA219 works by measuring the tiny voltage drop across its built-in shunt resistor. If no load is connected, no current flows, and the shunt voltage is: 0 volts. With nothing to measure, the sensor cannot calculate current or power.\n4. The Load Determines Real-World Behaviour Different loads draw different amounts of current — and this is what makes the power meter useful. A fan, LED strip, or DC motor will each produce unique readings. Measuring a real load lets you:\nProfile power consumption Test efficiency Monitor battery discharge Compare different devices 5. Without a Load, You’re Only Measuring the Power Supply Itself If there’s no load, the INA219 ends up monitoring nothing but the open-circuit voltage of your power supply — which isn’t useful for a power meter or logger.\nSummary You need a load because it creates current flow. That current flow creates a voltage drop across the shunt resistor. The INA219 uses that voltage drop to calculate current and power.\nReference https://www.adafruit.com/product/904 https://learn.adafruit.com/pro-trinket-power-meter/usage https://lastminuteengineers.com/i2c-lcd-arduino-tutorial/ https://www.instructables.com/Make-Your-Own-Power-MeterLogger/ ","description":"A circuit designed to measure voltage drop and shunt current across a load.","tags":["tech","hardware"],"title":"Volt/Amp Meter with INA219, Nano and LCD display","uri":"/project/2025/ina219-lcd-display/"},{"content":"How to Set Up Your Own Email on Your Domain Name Having your own email address at your custom domain name adds a professional touch to your communications. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own email address using your domain and integrating it with Gmail for sending and receiving emails. This guide will show how I set up my own email address at tien@tienng.xyz.\nI wrote this guide using informations from IdeaSpot’s video so feel free to check it out.\nPrerequisites A custom domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com). Access to your domain’s DNS settings. A transactional email service like Brevo. A Cloudflare account with ‘yourdomain.com’ already linked. A Gmail account. Step 1: Receiving Emails with Cloudflare Email Routing Cloudflare offers a free email routing service that allows you to receive emails sent to your custom domain and forward them to an existing email address (e.g., Gmail).\nConfigure Cloudflare Email Routing Log in to your Cloudflare account and select your domain.\nNavigate to the Email tab in the Cloudflare dashboard.\nClick Set up Email Routing and follow the prompts.\nAdd the required DNS records to enable email routing:\nMX Record: Points to Cloudflare’s email servers (e.g., mx.example.com). TXT Record: For SPF, to authorise email forwarding from your domain. CNAME Record: For DKIM, to ensure email authentication. Cloudflare will provide specific instructions for adding these records.\nConfigure email forwarding by specifying the custom email address you want to create (e.g., you@yourdomain.com) and the destination email address (e.g., yourname@gmail.com).\nSave your changes and allow time for the DNS records to propagate (typically a few minutes to a few hours).\nTest Email Forwarding Send a test email to your custom email address (e.g., you@yourdomain.com). Confirm that the email is successfully forwarded to your Gmail inbox. Step 2: Sending Emails with Your Custom Domain To send emails from your custom email address, you’ll need to set up an SMTP service. In this guide, we’ll use Brevo.\nYou could choose between gmail SMTP or Brevo SMTP; If choose gmail SMTP, skip anything related to Brevo.\nConfigure Your Domain in Brevo Sign up for a Brevo account if you don’t already have one. Click on Profile name, go to “Senders, Domains \u0026 Dedicated IPs”, go to “Domains” tab, add your custom domain. Brevo will help you with adding DNS records to your domain, since I linked my domain name to Cloudflare, I could just choose “sign-in with Cloudflare” option and Brevo would add the DNS records automatically for me. Once the DNS records propagate (this may take a few hours), your domain will be “Authenticated”. Brevo provides detailed instructions for adding these records in your DNS settings. Then go to “SMTP \u0026 API” and generate a new SMTP key and remember the password. Connect Your Custom Email to Gmail for Sending Open Gmail and go to Settings (gear icon) \u003e See all settings. Navigate to the Accounts and Import tab. Under Send mail as, click Add another email address. Enter your name (sender’s name) and custom email address (e.g., you@yourdomain.com) which you set-up earlier in Cloudflare, then click Next Step. Enable “alias” to easily choosing which email to send from in every mail, if not enabled, gmail will send all email from your custom email address. For Brevo SMTP Use the following SMTP settings: SMTP Server: smtp-relay.brevo.com Port: 587 Username: Your Brevo login email (In the SMTP \u0026 API tab) Password: The SMTP key you generated earlier Authentication: Ensure “Secured connection using TLS” is selected For Gmail SMTP Use the following SMTP settings: SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com Port: 587 Username: Your gmail (The gmail you forwarded to) Password: App Password generated by Google Authentication: Ensure “Secured connection using TLS” is selected Click Add Account and verify ownership by entering the code sent to your custom email address (check your Gmail inbox for the forwarded message) Troubleshooting Sending Issues If you encounter an “Authentication failed” error:\nDouble-check the SMTP settings in Gmail and ensure they match Brevo’s specifications. Verify that your SMTP key is active and correctly entered. Consult this Brevo Community post for setting up Gmail SMTP instead. Final Steps: Test Your Setup Send a test email from Gmail using your custom email address. Verify that you can send and receive emails without issues. Congratulations! You’ve successfully set up your custom email address for both sending and receiving emails.\n","description":"No more dependance on Gmail for your Email services, a way to host that yourself...","title":"My Own Email Domain","uri":"/post/2025/my-own-email-domain/"},{"content":"Introduction Secure Shell (SSH) is a powerful tool for remotely accessing and managing servers. Setting up SSH key-based authentication eliminates the need for passwords and enhances security. This guide walks you through the process of setting up an SSH connection without a password to a remote server.\nStep 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair The first step is to create a public and private SSH key pair on your local machine. If you already have an SSH key pair, you can skip this step.\nOpen a terminal on your local machine.\nRun the following command:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\" NOTE: ssh-keygen uses default options if no flag provided.\n-t rsa: Specifies the RSA algorithm.(optional) -b 4096: Generates a 4096-bit key for extra security. (optional) -C \"your_email@example.com\": Adds a comment to identify the key. (optional) Save the key to the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) with a key name to store the key when prompted.\nConsider adding a passphrase to the key for extra security.\nStep 2: Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server You need to transfer the public key to the remote server so it knows to trust your private key.\nOption 1: Use ssh-copy-id (Recommended) Run the following command:\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/\u003ckey_name\u003e \u003cuser\u003e@\u003cremote_host\u003e Replace \u003ckey_name\u003e with your key’s name you set earlier. Replace \u003cuser\u003e with your remote username. Replace \u003cremote_host\u003e with the server’s IP address or domain name. Option 2: Manually Copy the Key Display the contents of your public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Copy the output and paste it into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server: vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Ensure the file has the correct permissions: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Test the Connection Verify that you can connect to the server without a password:\nssh -i .ssh/\u003ckey_name\u003e \u003cuser\u003e@\u003cremote_host\u003e NOTE: The “-i” flag is used to point to your key’s location, not needed to specify when key’s name is default as you should be logged in without being prompted for a password.\nStep 4: Disable Password Authentication (Optional but Recommended) To enhance security, disable password authentication on the remote server. This ensures only users with the private key can log in.\nNOTE: This will block password login from ssh but still allow on-site direct connection with hdmi and monitor.\nOpen the SSH daemon configuration file on the remote server: sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config Set the following options: PasswordAuthentication no PermitRootLogin no Port 666 # Default is 22, everyone knows that :/ NOTE: Add flag “-p \u003cPORT_NUM\u003e” when ssh if changed PORT.\nRestart the SSH service: sudo systemctl restart sshd SUPER IMPORTANT !!! Before disabling password authentication, ensure you have tested key-based access and confirmed it works.\nTroubleshooting 1. SSH Still Asks for a Password Ensure the public key is in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote server. Check file permissions: chmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Verify the SSH configuration: sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config Ensure PubkeyAuthentication yes is enabled. 2. Debug the SSH Connection Use verbose mode to debug:\nssh -v \u003cuser\u003e@\u003cremote_host\u003e This will provide detailed output about the connection process.\nConclusion Setting up SSH key-based authentication not only improves security but also makes logging into remote servers more convenient. By following the steps above, you can eliminate the need for passwords and protect your server against brute-force attacks.\nRemember to keep your private key secure, and consider disabling password authentication for maximum security.\nHappy server managing!\n","description":"Setting Up SSH Connection Without Password to a Remote Server'...","title":"SSH Connection (Without Password) to a Remote Server","uri":"/post/2025/ssh-key-config/"},{"content":"Setting Up a Raspberry Pi Home Server with Docker A Raspberry Pi can be transformed into a powerful and lightweight home server with the right configuration. In this guide, I will walk you through my setup process, starting from installing the Raspberry Pi OS Lite to configuring Docker containers and setting up essential services for remote file access, media streaming, and more.\nStep 1: Install 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite To maximise performance and compatibility, I opted for the 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite with no GUI. Here are the steps I followed:\nDownload the OS: Visit the official Raspberry Pi website and download the latest 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite. Flash the SD Card: Flash the OS onto the sd card using tool like Raspberry Pi Imager. Enable SSH: Set up password for user and enable SSH before starting the flashing proccess. Boot the Pi: Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on. Connect via SSH. Step 2: Install Docker Docker is the backbone of this setup, allowing me to run and manage services efficiently in isolated containers, also uses far lesser computer resources than on a VM or BareMetal.\npimylifeup’s guide Update the System: sudo apt update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt upgrade -y Install Docker: curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh Add User to Docker Group: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Log out and back in to apply group changes. Step 3: Install Portainer Portainer provides an intuitive web interface for managing Docker containers.\nPull the Portainer Image: docker volume create portainer_data docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest Access the Interface: Open a browser and navigate to https://\u003cRaspberry_Pi_IP\u003e:9443 to set up Portainer. Step 4: Mount an External Hard Drive This guide explains how to mount an external hard drive to your Raspberry Pi, set ownership and permissions, and make these changes persist across reboots.\nIdentify the Drive Plug in your external hard drive.\nIdentify the drive using lsblk:\nlsblk Look for your drive (e.g., /dev/sda1).\nGet the UUID of the partition:\nsudo blkid /dev/sda1 Copy the UUID of your drive (e.g., UUID=\"1234-5678\").\nCreate a Mount Point Create a directory to mount the drive:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/extdrive (Optional) Adjust permissions for the directory:\nsudo chmod 755 /mnt/data Add the Drive to /etc/fstab Open /etc/fstab for editing:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab Add an entry for the drive:\nUUID=1234-5678 /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 2 Replace 1234-5678 with your drive’s UUID. Adjust the filesystem type (ext4, ntfs, etc.) as necessary. Save and exit the editor.\nTest the configuration:\nsudo mount -a If there are no errors, your drive is now mounted.\nSet Ownership and Permissions Change ownership of the mount point to a specific user (e.g., tien):\nsudo chown -R tien:tien /mnt/data (Optional) Adjust permissions if multiple users need access:\nsudo chmod -R 775 /mnt/data Automate Ownership Changes (if Needed) The chown command does not persist across reboots. To automate this:\nOption A: Use /etc/rc.local Open or create the rc.local file:\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local Add the chown command before exit 0:\nchown -R tien:tien /mnt/data Save the file and make it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local Option B: Use a systemd Service Create a new systemd service:\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/fix-permissions.service Add the following content:\n[Unit] Description=Fix ownership of /mnt/data After=local-fs.target [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/bin/chown -R tien:tien /mnt/data [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Save and enable the service:\nsudo systemctl enable fix-permissions.service Verify the Setup Reboot your Raspberry Pi:\nsudo reboot After reboot, check the ownership and permissions of the mount point:\nls -ld /mnt/data You should see the correct ownership (e.g., tien:tien).\nBy following these steps, your external hard drive will be properly mounted and accessible, with ownership and permissions configured to persist across reboots.\nStep 5: Encrypt the External Hard Drive with LUKS with Keyfile These commands are used to create a partition on a disk, encrypt it, and mount it on a specific mount point. All of this automatically without entering a password at boot.\nVideo tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXJrSji-nNo\nIf you need to create your partitions on your disk: List partitions sudo fdisk -l This command lists all the available disks and their partitions on the system. It’s used to find the name of the disk that you want to partition. My disk is “sda” (find your’s name)\nWipe the hard-drive if there is still something on there sudo wipefs --all /dev/sda Create partition sudo fdisk /dev/sda This command starts the fdisk partitioning utility on the /dev/sda disk. From here, you can create a new partition by selecting “n” and following the prompts.\n“n” to create a new partition, “d” to delete the partition, “p” to check the partition table “w” to write.\nVerify partition was created lsblk -f It’s used to verify that the partition was created with the correct filesystem.\nEncrypting with LUKS sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1 This command encrypts the newly created partition using the LUKS encryption format. You’ll be prompted to enter a passphrase to secure the encryption.\nUnlock the LUKS partition sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 storage This command unlocks the encrypted partition and maps it to the device named “storage”, or could be any name you like.\nCreate the LUKS filesystem sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/storage This command creates a new ext4 filesystem on the encrypted partition.\nUsing a keyfile Create the keyfile sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/keyfile bs=1024 count=4 This command generates a super complex password to be used to unlock the encrypted partition.\nSet keyfile permissions sudo chmod 0400 /root/keyfile This command sets the permissions of the keyfile so it can only be read.\nAdding keyfile to LUKS sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /root/keyfile This command adds the generated keyfile as an additional key to the LUKS encryption.\nRetrieve the UUID of LUKS partition sudo cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/sda1 This command retrieves the UUID of the encrypted partition, which is needed to configure the crypttab file.\nEdit crypttab Open crypttab sudo vim /etc/crypttab This command opens the crypttab file for editing. This file is used to configure the encrypted partition to be automatically unlocked at boot time.\nAdd the unlock partition in crypttab databank /dev/disk/by-uuid/\u003cYOUR_DISK_UUID\u003e /root/keyfile luks This tells the system to unlock the partition with the UUID (above) using the keyfile located at /root/keyfile, and to map it to the device named “databank”.\nEdit FSTAB Open FSTAB sudo vim /etc/fstab This file is used to configure the system to automatically mount the encrypted partition at boot time.\nAdd the mountpoint to FSTAB It is the volume in /dev/mapper that you see using lsblk -f\n/dev/mapper/databank /mnt/extdrive ext4 defaults 0 2 This line tells the system to mount the device named “databank” (which was created in the previous step) at the mount point /mnt/extdrive using the ext4 filesystem.\nMount point Create the mount point sudo mkdir /media/databank This command creates the mount point directory for the encrypted partition.\nSetting the ownership sudo chown tien /mnt/extdrive This command sets the ownership of the mount point directory to the user “tien”.\nReboot sudo reboot now Reset the ownership again sudo chown tien /mnt/extdrive This command sets the ownership of the mounted partition to the user “tien” temporarily. Or better to set this automatically at boot here. Verifications Verify partitions lsblk -f Verify that mountpoint is readable and writable cd /media/databank/ touch a ls Step 6: Install FileBrowser FileBrowser is a lightweight file management solution, perfect for 4GB RAM Raspberry Pi 4. We could also create tunnel to FileBrowser with CloudFlares to have a NAS/cloud functions. I chose FileBrowser because Samba is too minimal and don’t have web GUI, NextCloud is over-featured and heavy.\nRun FileBrowser in Docker: docker run -v /path/to/root:/srv -v /path/to/filebrowser.db:/database/filebrowser.db -e PUID=$(id -u) -e PGID=$(id -g) -p 8080:80 filebrowser/filebrowser:s6 NOTE: The “/path/to/root” is storage space(/mnt/extdrive), “/path/to/filebrowser” is database. Only modify the path to the left of the colon ‘:’.\nAccess FileBrowser: Navigate to http://\u003cRaspberry_Pi_IP\u003e:8080 and log in with the default credentials. Step 7: Buy a Domain Name I purchased the domain name tienng.xyz from gen.xyz. After purchasing, I configured DNS settings to point to my Raspberry Pi using Cloudflare.\nStep 8: Set Up Cloudflare Tunnel Since I could not enable port forwarding on my school’s network, I used Cloudflare Tunnel to access my Raspberry Pi services remotely.\nRegister an Account on Cloudflare: Verify Domain Name: Add a domain, choose Free plan, input given Cloudflare’s nameservers to my domain’s setting on gen.xyz, you will be taken to Quick Start Guide and can just choose default options. Remember to press “check Nameservers again” and wait for confirmation in email. Create a Tunnel: After successfully verifying your domain name, press your domain name, in Access tab press “Launch Zero Trust”, on the left sidebar find Networks tab and choose Tunnels, create a new tunnel and follow the intructions on the page. Access Services: I mapped cloud.tienng.xyz to FileBrowser, enabling secure external access to my files. –\u003e BUT at this point, we have our tunnel up and running but literally ANYONE can get into our network, there may be cases where you DO want to open up a tunnel connection to the whole wide world (such as if you’re running a public web server), but in this case, we’re just trying to access some stuff on our own local LAN – we absolutely do not want the whole wide world to be able to connect in – we only want to be able to access it ourselves!\nAdd Application for Authentication: https://www.crosstalksolutions.com/cloudflare-tunnel-easy-setup/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey4u7OUAF3c\u0026list=WL\u0026index=14 (NetworkChuck Remote Network) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65FdHRs0axE\u0026list=WL\u0026index=9\u0026pp=gAQBiAQB (Restrict Cloudflare Application) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdmbAo02ktQ\u0026list=WL\u0026index=8\u0026pp=gAQBiAQB (Restrict to Google\u0026Github Auth) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnw616HiINY\u0026list=WL\u0026index=5\u0026pp=gAQBiAQB (SSH Remote Connection) Step 9: Set Up Immich and Navidrome Immich and Navidrome are excellent solutions for managing photos and music streaming, respectively.\nInstall Immich: docker run -d --name=immich -p 3000:3000 -v /mnt/extdrive/immich:/data ghcr.io/immich-app/server Install Navidrome: docker run -d --name=navidrome -p 4533:4533 -v /mnt/extdrive/music:/data navidrome/navidrome:latest Access Services: Immich: http://\u003cRaspberry_Pi_IP\u003e:3000 Navidrome: http://\u003cRaspberry_Pi_IP\u003e:4533 Step 10: Set Up Pi-Hole on Portainer Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that works at the DNS level, preventing unwanted content from ever reaching your devices. Running it in Docker makes it portable, easy to manage, and isolated from your host system. This guide explains how to set up Pi-hole using Docker. See the guide here. 1. Clear port 53 Guide bash -c \"$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbeartechworld/big-bear-scripts/master/disable-dns-service/disable_dns_service.sh)\" 2. Add Pi-Hole Stack on Portainer Script # Docker Compose version version: \"3\" # Define services (containers to be created) services: # Service name: pihole pihole: # Name of the container instance container_name: pihole # Image to use for this container # Use the specified version of the pihole image image: pihole/pihole:2024.07.0 # Expose and map ports (host:container) ports: - \"53:53/tcp\" # DNS (TCP) - \"53:53/udp\" # DNS (UDP) - \"7300:80/tcp\" # Web UI HTTP # Environment variables environment: TZ: \"UTC\" # Time Zone; Update this to your time zone WEBPASSWORD: \"password\" # Admin password for web UI; Change this to your desired admin password # Mount volumes for persistent data volumes: - \"/data/pihole/data/pihole:/etc/pihole\" # Pi-hole data - \"/data/pihole/data/dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d\" # dnsmasq data # Restart policy for the container when it exits restart: unless-stopped # DNS servers for this container to use dns: - 127.0.0.1 # Localhost for internal resolution - 1.1.1.1 # Cloudflare DNS for external resolution Adjust the TZ and WEBPASSWORD as necessary. The volumes section ensures Pi-hole data persists between container restarts (keep default).\n3. Start the Container Deploy Stack 4. Access the Pi-hole Admin Interface Once the container is running, access the Pi-hole web interface by navigating to the IP address of your Docker host in a web browser. For example:\nhttp://192.168.4.178:7300/admin Log in using the password you set during configuration.\n5. Configure Your Network To start blocking ads, set your router or device DNS to point to your Pi-hole instance. Typically, this involves:\nLogging into your router’s admin interface. Setting the DNS server to the IP address of your Docker host. Alternatively, configure individual devices to use Pi-hole as their DNS server.\nPi-hole Troubleshooting Issue: Pi-hole web interface doesn’t load.\nSolution: Check if the container is running: docker ps. Restart it if necessary: docker restart pihole. Issue: DNS resolution isn’t working.\nSolution: Ensure the required ports (53 and 80) are not used by other services. Issue: Configuration doesn’t persist after a restart.\nSolution: Verify that the volumes are correctly mounted. Common Errors and Solutions 1. Conflict between Nameservers and Manual DNS on Domain Hosting platform At first when I had my personal website at tienng.xyz only, I had to choose either keeping the website alive or the tunnels to my RaspberryPi Server since my domain registrar gen.xyz only allow either “Nameservers” or “Manual DNS records”. Since all of my services provided by Cloudflares so I decided to assign Cloudflares’ nameservers to my domain registrar. This means that Cloudflare is now in charge of all the DNS records instead of my domain hosting service gen.xyz.\nThe purpose of a nameserver like Cloudflare is to handle the Domain Name System (DNS) for your domain.\nBy switching to Cloudflare’s nameservers, all DNS settings are controlled through Cloudflare’s interface instead of your domain registrar.\nConclusion This setup transformed my Raspberry Pi into a versatile home server capable of file management, media streaming, and photo management—all accessible remotely through a secure Cloudflare Tunnel. With Docker, adding or modifying services is a breeze, making this setup highly customisable and scalable.\n","description":"A complete home server with integrated music, media and file storage services.","tags":["tech","automation"],"title":"RaspberryPi Home Server","uri":"/project/2025/raspberry-pi-server/"},{"content":"Inspiration I had always wanted to build my own website, no Wordpress or any third-party hosting bloats that rip your pocket! This is also for storing information and experiences I gained throughout my learning journey in the world of tech and engineering so I don’t have to crawling through my dusting physical A4 notebooks or proprietary gg docs :/\nSet Up HUGO I built this website with Hugo and Github Page, a cool fast minimalist combo for hosting with no databases, just raw mark-down texts and basic html, css, js skills :)\nDownload Hugo\nSet up 2 new Github repositories: “USERNAME.github.io” and “blog”\n(blog is where I keep all the drafts and themes so I could modify locally, USERNAME.github.io is a github page for publishing the real website in the “public” folder of hugo workspace).\nClone your blog repository to your local machine git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/blog.\ncd blog and create a hugo workspace hugo new site myblog.\ncd myblog git clone https://github.com/binokochumolvarghese/lightbi-hugo themes/lightbi-hugo (lightbi-hugo)\nCreate a git submodule of public folder, link it to the publishing page USERNAME.github.io, We do this so everytime we finalise with ‘hugo’, the new code will be auto pushed to ‘public’ and we could cd into ‘public’ to git push our website into github.io repo: git submodule add -b main https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git public/ (Refs)\n*NOTE: if error, delete the folder public !\nNow you can customise any html, css, js files you see in themes folder and preview with hugo serve, go to http://localhost:1313/ to view your website in development mode.\nYou can publish new posts with hugo new content content/posts/my-first-post.md.\nOnce you satisfy with everything simply publish the website by typing hugo, remember to delete everything in public folder everytime you publish to avoid any collision cause hugo will generate a new website in public folder everytime.\nAdd, Commit and Push to Gihub repos and enjoy your page at USERNAME.github.io.\nHow To ? 1. Link Images (reference) Option 1: Decentralized Images (images saved separately with each posts) Instead of putting all the posts in the “posts” directory which is super messy later on, you could create separate directories for each post and create an index.md in each folder along with prefered images: *NOTE: if error, specify the image with “./a.jpg” because different Hugo template has different way of specifying relative address (or just cancel and hugo serve again) !\nOption 2: Centralised Images (all images saved in static directory) Step 1: Organise Your Image Files Navigate to the static directory in your Hugo project:\ncd \u003cyour-hugo-project\u003e/static Create a folder to store your images (e.g., images):\nmkdir images Add your image file(s) to the newly created folder:\ncp /path/to/your/image.jpg \u003cyour-hugo-project\u003e/static/images/ Step 2: Link the Image in Your Post Open your post file in the content directory (e.g., content/posts/example.md):\nvim content/posts/example.md Use the Markdown syntax to add the image:\n![Alt text describing the image](/images/image.jpg) Replace Alt text describing the image with a short description of the image. Adjust the path (/images/image.jpg) to match your file location. Step 3: Resize or Align Images (Optional) Resize Images Use the width and height attributes in HTML within your Markdown file:\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/image.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"\u003e Centre Align Images Wrap the image in a \u003cdiv\u003e tag with a style attribute:\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/images/image.jpg\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"600\"\u003e \u003c/div\u003e Step 4: Test Your Post Start the Hugo development server:\nhugo serve Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:1313 to verify that the image appears correctly.\n1a. Canvas of images Here’s a custom Hugo shortcode that creates an image gallery in a masonry style using GLightbox, allowing you to specify a folder containing images. This approach will display images from a specified folder in a masonry layout, and each image will open in a lightbox when clicked.\nShortcode:\n{{/*\u003c img_gallery folder=\"img/travel/\" \u003e*/}} 2. Link custom domain to Gihub Page (reference) Step 1: Add Github’s DNS records to domain hosting site Go to this website, go the “Configuring an apex domain” and at step 5, copy the 4 IP addresses. Go to domain provider and edit your domain’s DNS settings to include those 4 IP addresses with a “www” host name with CNAME record pointing to your Gihub Pages: OR through Cloudflare Nameservers\nAdd DNS Records to Cloudflare\nStep 2: Add Customed Domain to Github Page Go to Github Page repository .github.io, go to Settings then Pages. Add your domain to “Custom domain” section. Wait up to a day for https to be active for secure connection.

This step is optional but improves readability in some cases. Verify Boot Mode (Optional) Check if the system is booted in UEFI mode:\ncat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size # If the result is \"64\", the system is using UEFI boot. UEFI boot mode is required for systems that use modern boot managers like GRUB in EFI mode. Internet Connection On a Virtual Machine Check for network connectivity:\nip link ip link shows the status of all network devices. Look for the “UP” symbol. If all network interfaces show DOWN, follow these steps:\nReboot to the boot page. Enter Firmware Settings. Go to the network tab and select the displayed MAC address (the network adapter). Reboot into the Arch Linux installation medium. Verify connectivity: ip link # One interface should now show \"UP\" On a Bare Metal System Use iwctl to connect to Wi-Fi:\niwctl device list station wlan0 get-networks station wlan0 connect \u003cwifi_name\u003e device list displays available network adapters. Replace wlan0 with the name of your wireless interface. Use get-networks to see nearby Wi-Fi networks and connect to join one. For Ethernet (wired) connections:\nip link # A network adapter should show \"UP\" Verify the connection:\nping youtube.com A successful ping means your internet connection is active. Partitioning Start the partition tool and point it to the desired drive, not the bootable drive:\ncfdisk /dev/sda Choose “GPT”, “DOS” is typically for usb sticks!\nGPT (GUID Partition Table) is the modern standard for partitioning. Create the following partitions:\nEFI System: ≥ 500MB (for booting) Swap: ≥ 1GB (for memory overflow) Linux Root: Remaining storage Verify the partitions:\nlsblk lsblk lists all storage devices and partitions. Note their names (e.g., /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2). Formatting the Partitions Format the partitions as follows:\n# EFI System mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/\u003cefi_partition\u003e # Swap mkswap /dev/\u003cswap_partition\u003e # Linux Root mkfs.ext4 /dev/\u003croot_partition\u003e EFI System: Use mkfs.fat -F 32 because EFI requires the FAT32 file system. Swap: mkswap initializes a swap partition. Linux Root: mkfs.ext4 sets up the main filesystem. Mounting the Partitions Mount the partitions in this order:\n# Linux Root mount /dev/\u003croot_partition\u003e /mnt # EFI System mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi mount /dev/\u003cefi_partition\u003e /mnt/boot/efi # Swap swapon /dev/\u003cswap_partition\u003e Verify with:\nlsblk The mounted partitions should now appear under /mnt. Installing the Base System Install essential packages:\npacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware sudo vim grub efibootmgr # Optional: Add git and networkmanager base: Core Arch Linux system packages. linux: The kernel. linux-firmware: Firmware for hardware compatibility. sudo: Required for managing administrative tasks. vim: A text editor for editing configuration files. grub and efibootmgr: Tools for bootloader setup. Note: If you encounter errors such as “Failed to install packages,” refer to the Arch Wiki for troubleshooting.\nGenerating fstab Generate the filesystem table and verify:\ngenfstab -U /mnt \u003e\u003e /mnt/etc/fstab vim /mnt/etc/fstab # Check partition entries fstab stores partition mounting information. Ensure it includes all three partitions. Chroot into the New System Change root into the new installation:\narch-chroot /mnt This changes the environment to the newly installed Arch Linux system. Set Time and Location Set the system time: ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/\u003cRegion\u003e/\u003cCity\u003e /etc/localtime hwclock --systohc Verify: hwclock hwclock --systohc synchronises the hardware clock with the system time. Localisation Edit locale configuration: vim /etc/locale.gen Uncomment: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 Generate the locale: locale-gen Setting the Hostname Create a hostname for your machine:\nvim /etc/hostname # Enter your desired machine name The hostname identifies your computer on a network. Set Root Password Set the root password:\npasswd This password is required for the root user to log in. Adding a User Add a new user and set a password: useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash \u003cusername\u003e passwd \u003cusername\u003e Enable sudo for the user: Edit visudo: EDITOR=vim visudo Uncomment the line for the “wheel” group: %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL Installing the Bootloader Install and configure GRUB:\ngrub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg grub-install sets up the bootloader in EFI mode. grub-mkconfig generates the GRUB configuration file. Reboot Exit the chroot environment: exit Optionally, unmount all partitions: umount -R /mnt Reboot the system: reboot Remove the installation medium and log in as the root user.\nPost-Installation Congratulations!

They enable enhanced flexibility and are a core part of Hugo’s functionality, offering reusable snippets for embedding media, custom components, or dynamic content. Below, we’ll explore what shortcodes are and highlight some popular examples.\nWhat are Hugo Shortcodes? Shortcodes in Hugo are like mini-templates that simplify embedding specialized content into a page. Hugo has built-in shortcodes, and users can create custom ones. For instance, to embed a YouTube video, instead of writing the full HTML, you can use a shortcode like {{/*\u003c youtube \"video-id\" \u003e */}}.\nCommon Built-in Shortcodes Here are a few popular Hugo shortcodes and how to use them:\nYouTube Embed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44 Shortcode:\n{{\u003c youtube 3qHkcs3kG44 \u003e}} Rendered output: This shortcode takes a YouTube video ID, simplifying the process of embedding videos on your page.\nFigure: Shortcode:\n{{/*\u003c figure src=\"/img/posts/img-0.jpg\" title=\"Sample Image\" \u003e*/}} Rendered output: Sample Image This allows you to easily add images with captions and titles, handling image display responsively.\nGist (GitHub Snippets):\nShortcode:\n{{/*\u003c gist spf13 7896402 \u003e */}} Rendered: This integrates GitHub Gists by taking the username and gist ID, perfect for adding code snippets from GitHub.\nTwitter url:\nhttps://twitter.com/binovarghese_/status/1758148486510317907 Shortcode:\n{{\u003c twitter user=\"binovarghese_\" id=\"1758148486510317907\" \u003e}} Rendered: {{\u003c twitter user=“binovarghese_” id=“1758148486510317907” \u003e}}\nBenefits of Shortcodes Using shortcodes in Hugo streamlines content creation and ensures consistency across pages, saving time on repeated elements and complex HTML structures. With custom shortcodes, you can build rich, interactive content while keeping Markdown files clean and easy to manage.\nFor more details, check out Hugo’s official shortcode documentation.\n","description":"Hugo shortcodes are powerful tools for adding custom HTML or other special content within Markdown files without complex code...","tags":["shortcodes"],"title":"Understanding Hugo Shortcodes","uri":"/post/2020/understanding-hugo-shortcodes/"},{"content":"To create your own shortcodes in Hugo, add an HTML file in layouts/shortcodes/.
